# 🧪 Testing Philosophy

This project is hands-on and output-visualization focused. Verification is mainly performed by:

- Directly running scripts and confirming math/plots match expectations.
- Checking output with simple, known analytic solutions (e.g., gradient of \(x^2 + y^2\) at (1,1) should be (2,2)).
- Comparing code results to textbook or NumPy/scipy results for new algorithms.

As the project grows, functional and regression tests will be added here.
