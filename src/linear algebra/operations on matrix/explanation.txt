EXPLANATION OF MATRIX OPERATIONS CODE
====================================

This project implements fundamental linear algebra matrix operations from scratch
using only native Python data structures (lists and loops). No external numerical
libraries such as NumPy are used. The goal is to demonstrate a clear understanding
of how matrix computations work internally.

--------------------------------------------------
Matrix Representation
--------------------------------------------------
A matrix is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to
one row of the matrix.

Example:
A = [[1, 2],
     [3, 4]]

Here, A has 2 rows and 2 columns.

--------------------------------------------------
1. shape(A)
--------------------------------------------------
Returns the dimensions of matrix A.

Implementation:
- len(A) gives the number of rows.
- len(A[0]) gives the number of columns.

This function is used by all other operations to ensure correct iteration over
matrix elements.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Matrix Addition: 
--------------------------------------------------
Performs element-wise addition of two matrices A and B.

Mathematical definition:
(A + B)ij = Aij + Bij

Implementation details:
- Iterates through each row and column.
- Adds corresponding elements from A and B.
- Stores the result in a new matrix.

Both matrices must have the same dimensions.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Matrix Subtraction:
--------------------------------------------------
Performs element-wise subtraction of matrix B from matrix A.

Mathematical definition:
(A − B)ij = Aij − Bij

Implementation is identical to matrix addition, except subtraction is used.

--------------------------------------------------
4. Scalar Multiplication: 
--------------------------------------------------
Multiplies every element of matrix A by a scalar value k.

Mathematical definition:
(kA)ij = k · Aij

The shape of the matrix remains unchanged.

--------------------------------------------------
5. Transpose:
--------------------------------------------------
Computes the transpose of matrix A by converting rows into columns.

Mathematical definition:
(AT)ij = Aji

Implementation details:
- Outer loop iterates over columns of A.
- Inner loop iterates over rows of A.
- Each column of A becomes a row in the transposed matrix.

--------------------------------------------------
6. Matrix-Vector Multiplication: 
--------------------------------------------------
Multiplies a matrix A with a vector x.

Mathematical definition:
(Ax)i = Σj Aij xj

Implementation details:
- Each row of A is dotted with vector x.
- Produces a new vector with length equal to the number of rows of A.

--------------------------------------------------
7. Matrix-Matrix Multiplication: matmul(A, B)
--------------------------------------------------
Computes the product of two matrices A and B.

Dimension rule:
Number of columns in A must equal number of rows in B.

Mathematical definition:
(AB)ij = Σk Aik Bkj

Implementation details:
- Uses three nested loops:
  - Outer loop over rows of A.
  - Middle loop over columns of B.
  - Inner loop performs the summation over index k.
- Builds the resulting matrix row by row.

--------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------
These matrix operations form the foundation of linear algebra and are critical for
understanding optimization algorithms, machine learning models, and numerical
methods. Implementing them from scratch provides insight into how high-level
numerical libraries operate internally.
