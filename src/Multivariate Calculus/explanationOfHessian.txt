# Hessian Matrix (From Scratch)

Numerical computation of the Hessian matrix for multivariable functions without external libraries.

The Hessian captures second-order curvature information and is essential for:
- Newton's Method
- Convexity analysis
- Optimization theory

Central difference schemes are used for all derivatives.
