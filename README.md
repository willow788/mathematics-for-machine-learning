Mathematics From Scratch: Visual & Computational Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of mathematical projects built from first principles, without relying on high-level numerical libraries.
The goal is to demonstrate a deep understanding of the mathematics behind modern AI/ML through linear algebra, multivariate calculus, vector calculus, and differential equations implemented directly in code.

Each project includes:

Hand-written mathematical derivations

Code implementations using only fundamental tools

Visualizations (3D surfaces, contour plots, vector fields, transformations)

Explanations connecting the math to machine-learning intuition

📌 Why This Repository Exists

Modern ML frameworks hide most of the underlying math.
This repo does the opposite: it aims to show that every concept can be built from scratch using core mathematical definitions and logical steps.

📂 Project Categories
### 1. Multivariate Calculus

Projects exploring functions of several variables, gradients, and surfaces.

Examples include:

3D surface plots

Contour plots

Gradient and Hessian computation

Optimization landscapes (saddle points, minima, maxima)
2. Linear Algebra

Foundational structures behind ML, implemented and visualized without abstractions.

Topics will include:

Matrix operations from scratch

Eigenvalues & eigenvectors

Diagonalization

PCA built manually

Linear transformations visualized

Orthogonality & projections

Vector spaces & basis changes

3. Vector Calculus (Upcoming)

Divergence, curl, and gradient visualizations

Line & surface integrals

Fields and flows

Laplacian and PDE intuition

4. Applied Machine Learning Math (Upcoming)

Using the math from earlier sections to build small ML components manually:

Gradient descent

Logistic regression from scratch

Loss landscapes

Backpropagation

Optimization geometry

🖼️ Example Output

This repo includes plots such as 3D surfaces and contour maps generated manually from mathematical definitions.

(Example shown in repo preview.)

📦 Tech Stack
