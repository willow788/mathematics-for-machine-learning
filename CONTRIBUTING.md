# 🛠️ Contributing to Mathematics for Machine Learning

Thank you for your interest in improving this project! We welcome contributions that enhance features, improve explanations, add visualizations, or clarify the mathematics.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repo and clone your fork.
2. **Create** a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. **Make your changes**, ensuring your code and explanations are clear.
4. **Test locally**—run the relevant Python scripts, especially if you modify logic.
5. **Commit** with concise and descriptive messages.
6. **Push** to your fork and open a **pull request** targeting `main`.

## Types of Contributions

- Adding new mathematical modules, examples, or algorithms
- Improving visualizations, readability, or performance
- Expanding or clarifying documentation (README or doc pages)
- Fixing bugs or addressing edge-cases
- Suggesting roadmap features via Issues or Discussions

## Code Style

- Use Python >=3.8 and standard style (PEP8).
- Prefer plain Python and minimal dependencies (NumPy, matplotlib, SciPy).
- Add comments for tricky math or code sections.
- Use docstrings to document functions and classes.

## Testing

- Test all scripts you modify directly (`python path/to/script.py`).
- If you add new modules, consider including example use in the README or relevant doc page.
- (Optional) Add test cases to `tests/` if available.

## Submitting Issues

- Tag bugs, enhancements, or questions clearly.
- Provide environment details (Python version, OS) if relevant.
- Include error messages, screenshots, or script snippets to help debug.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. Everyone is welcome!
