I HAVE GOT TO DO AT LEAST 5 LECTURES TODAY AND 2 CHAPTERS OF ML BOOK. WILL DO 
I made this graph to show that pi is a irrational number ie. does not matter how hard it tries it never finishes or reaches it's goal, its always going to keep spiraling. it looks very beautiful!
doesn't the explanation reminds you of something? someone?
hmm... the whole instagram is blasting on this graph.. people are relating this graph with their unrecruited love and ambitions.
i wanted to make it for a long time.. but wasn't getting the formula as i forget everything and the reel was nowhere to be found so.. took this long
today, i got it and its really cold! my hands are almost numb.
heh, i talk too much

bye bye
if any recruiter is reading this in future , i swear i'm not lazy, i will work my ass off! please hire me. 

This is my end-semester break and i'm still studying (technically this is also studying right)
